# üîç Lead Capture Site Validation Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Validation

### ‚úÖ File Structure Check
- [ ] `index.html` - Main form page
- [ ] `thank-you.html` - Success page
- [ ] `lhs-logo.png` - Official logo file
- [ ] `netlify.toml` - Configuration file
- [ ] `functions/submit-lead.js` - Serverless function
- [ ] `README.md` - Documentation

### ‚úÖ Form Configuration Check
- [ ] Form has `data-netlify="true"` attribute
- [ ] Form has `name="backup-lead-form"` attribute
- [ ] Form action points to `/.netlify/functions/submit-lead`
- [ ] All required fields have `required` attribute
- [ ] Salesforce OID is correct: `00D8b0000023HqA`
- [ ] Return URL is set to `/thank-you.html`

### ‚úÖ Function Configuration Check
- [ ] Function handles POST requests only
- [ ] Function logs form data for backup
- [ ] Function forwards to Salesforce Web-To-Lead API
- [ ] Function handles errors gracefully

## Post-Deployment Validation

### ‚úÖ Netlify Dashboard Check
1. **Site Overview**

   - [ ] No build errors
   - [ ] Functions are detected and deployed

2. **Forms Tab**
   - [ ] Form is detected: "backup-lead-form"
   - [ ] Form submissions appear here after testing

3. **Functions Tab**
   - [ ] `submit-lead` function is listed
   - [ ] Function logs are accessible

### ‚úÖ Live Site Testing

#### Visual Check

### ‚úÖ Error Handling Test

#### Simulate Salesforce Failure

2. Submit form
3. Verify:
   - [ ] User still redirected to thank-you page
   - [ ] Form still logged in Netlify Forms
   - [ ] Error logged in function console

## üö® Critical Success Criteria

For 100% reliability, verify ALL of these:

   - ‚úÖ Netlify Forms captures submission
   - ‚úÖ Function forwards to Salesforce
   - ‚úÖ Both work independently

2. **Error Recovery Working**
   - ‚úÖ If Salesforce fails, Netlify backup still works
   - ‚úÖ User always gets success page
   - ‚úÖ No data is lost

3. **Monitoring Working**
   - ‚úÖ All submissions logged in Netlify dashboard
   - ‚úÖ Function logs provide debugging info
   - ‚úÖ Errors are clearly identified

## üîß Quick Fixes for Common Issues

**Form not submitting:**
```html
<!-- Ensure form has these attributes -->
<form data-netlify="true" name="backup-lead-form" action="/.netlify/functions/submit-lead" method="POST">
```

**Function not found:**
```toml
# Ensure netlify.toml has:
[build]
  functions = "functions"
```

**Salesforce not receiving:**
- Check OID: `00D8b0000023HqA`
- Verify Web-To-Lead is enabled in Salesforce
- Check function logs for Salesforce response

Remember: Even if Salesforce fails, Netlify backup ensures NO LEADS ARE LOST! üõ°Ô∏è
